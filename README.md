# dsh-worktable 🖥️

<p align="center"><b>English</b> · <a href="README.zh.md">简体中文</a></p>

**An agent-project workbench for DeepSeek Harness** — a sidebar app drawer that turns projects into dockable windows, plus built-in control rooms that watch each room's effective project members in real time.

## ✨ Feature tour

### 🧩 Sidebar app drawer

- Collects your self-hosted projects (and resident plugins like dsh-travelatlas) in one place
- Rename / icon / reorder / hide each project; per-project folder; **project ↔ conversation binding** — opening a project switches the chat pane to its bound conversation
- Collapse the sidebar and every project becomes a tappable square tile (icon only)
- A shared luminous navy glass theme covers the host sidebar, conversation header, message canvas, composer, settings dialog, drawer, and control room
- Settings → Appearance configures Web and sidebar background layers, glass/content colors, and text colors; the sidebar can be independent, sync only the accent, or sync all common colors and backgrounds, while `dsh-usage` keeps a separate hardware-monitor theme

### 🪟 Dockable split workspace

- Declarative layout presets (left column / top row / main grid + right chat pane)
- Draggable dividers, per-pane tabs, per-layout width persistence
- Built-in panes: **file explorer, terminal, browser, animation site, custom window**
- Custom window: send a requirement to a new or existing conversation; the agent builds it and the result auto-mounts into the window (locked)

### 🖥️ Control rooms

- Multiple named control rooms (the original overview is now an ordinary room): create, rename, copy, hide, archive, restore and delete even the final room
- Each room keeps only project IDs, ordering, rules, one optional management-conversation binding, layout, theme and card preferences; project master data, files, conversations, Token statistics and hardware data remain global
- Global search (`Ctrl+K` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) covers rooms, projects, bound conversations and rules, with direct navigation descriptors
- Room configuration can be exported/imported as `dsh-control-rooms-v1.json`; imports remap ID collisions and never overwrite project/session/global settings
- The browser's `window.__dshWorktable.controlRooms` is a typed manual/debug seam backed by localStorage. It is not an automatic DeepSeek/Host model-tool registration; DeepSeek cannot discover or call these commands until an official Client Tool surface or an explicit adapter is supplied. Destructive actions require an exact confirmation token and are audited locally
- 1-4-column card grid mirrors every effective project member in the room: working / needs you / done with live runtime, subagent counts and a cleaned message preview
- Drag project cards to reorder them; click a card to open its project and bound conversation, or click the control-room card to switch to its bound conversation
- Event-driven host snapshot mirroring — **zero polling, zero tokens**
- Glassmorphism cards, dark / light / system theme, neon status glows and a rotating comet on busy cards

## At a glance

| | |
|---|------|
| 🧩 Plugin type | Cordis plugin — host routes + web client, pure additive (no official plugin replaced) |
| 🪟 Workspace engine | Self-built split engine rendered into the host shell overlay seat |
| 💬 Chat pane | Reuses the host conversation — the plugin only selects sessions (`sessions.open`) |
| 📡 Status data | Mirror of the host session runtime snapshots (subscription-driven) |
| 💾 State | localStorage only (`dsh.worktable.controlRooms.v1`, `.trash.v1`, `.migrationBackup.v1` plus existing view/project keys); no workspace files touched |
| 🎨 UI | TypeScript + React (host externals) + vanilla CSS, dark-first with light theme |

## Quick start

1. **Install** (pick one):

   **A · one-liner (recommended)** — straight from the GitHub Release tarball, no Git needed:

   ```bash
   dsh plugin --profile web add "https://github.com/Aisland-SJL/dsh-worktable/releases/latest/download/dsh-worktable.tgz"
   ```

   **B · local clone (for hacking on the source)** — `link:` accepts a local absolute path only (no spaces in the path):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aisland-SJL/dsh-worktable.git
   dsh plugin --profile web add "link:<absolute path of the cloned dsh-worktable directory>/01_content"
   # e.g. cloned into D:\tools → dsh plugin --profile web add "link:D:/tools/dsh-worktable/01_content"
   ```

   Either way the `add` command registers `dsh-worktable` in the profile bundle list (writes to `~/.dsh`, may ask for authorization). If the `dsh` command is missing, use `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh` instead.
2. **Restart** the DSH web process, refresh the GUI
3. **Open a control room**: click a 🖥️ control-room card (including the default room, which is an ordinary deletable room) → bind one conversation (join existing or create new) → you get the live card grid
4. **Create projects**: sidebar ＋ → pick a layout preset, set a project folder

## Architecture

One package ships the **host Cordis plugin** and the **web client**:

- **host**: `/api/worktable/*` routes — health, file system, git, file read/write, site serving, mkdir, workspaces, native skin template; WebSocket `/api/worktable/term` for the terminal pane (PowerShell on Windows)
- **client**: injected into the sidebar and the shell overlay via the slot protocol; the split engine, tab model, drag/drop and persistence are self-built
- **control room**: reads the host session list snapshot (running / pending / completed, jobs, subagent catalogs) — an event-driven mirror, no model involvement
- **window tasks**: the agent writes `widget-result.json` into the project folder on completion; the client mounts the artifact into the addressed window and locks it

---

## Development & testing

```bash
cd 01_content
npm install
npm run build     # lib/index.js + lib/client.js
node --check lib/index.js
```

- **Build must run inside `01_content`** — building from the repo root writes `lib/` to the wrong place while the host keeps loading the old bundle
- The client bundle keeps the `window.__ModuleLoader__.load` handshake; `react` and `@deepseek-ai/*` stay external
- Regression: all `04_test/control-room-*.cjs` probes, `04_test/control-room-acceptance.cjs` (final bundle + domain/browser-path acceptance), `04_test/functional-diag.cjs` (20 steps, strict gate), the path matrix (`04_test/pathutil-matrix.cjs`) and update-check scenarios (`04_test/probe-update-scenarios.cjs`). Chrome probes use disposable headless profiles; a missing DSH service is reported as `SKIPPED`, never as a pass.
- Manual visual acceptance remains pending: restart the user's disposable DSH web profile, refresh the GUI, and verify room navigation, search focus, archive confirmation, import/export and per-room layout visually.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: After a DeepSeek Harness update, the worktable fails to open / the service fails to start?**

Don't panic: your data is safe — projects, bindings and layouts live in the browser (localStorage), and project files stay in your own project folders; upgrading or repairing never touches them. Pick the case that matches:

**Case A: Harness works, only the worktable needs updating**

- Open the worktable "Settings" → click "Check now"; when the amber update badge appears next to the worktable title, click it and choose "Copy AI prompt" to hand the upgrade to your AI assistant;
- Or simply re-run the install command (always installs the latest), then restart dsh web and refresh:

  ```bash
  dsh plugin --profile web add "https://github.com/Aisland-SJL/dsh-worktable/releases/latest/download/dsh-worktable.tgz"
  ```

**Case B: Harness itself is down** (service fails to start / "Failed to load plugins")

- First choice: upgrade Harness to the latest (official fixes usually ship there): run `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web`;
- If it still fails: copy the following to any AI assistant (Claude, Codex, GLM, … — DeepSeek Harness itself is not required):

> Help me fix DeepSeek Harness custom-plugin loading (the error is usually "Failed to load plugins" or the service failing to start):
> 1. Run npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web to upgrade to the latest and start; if it works, done.
> 2. If it still fails: open ~/.dsh/profiles/web/package.json, find every dependency starting with link:, and compute their common parent directory (e.g. if all plugins live under D:\projects, the parent is D:\projects).
> 3. Create a node_modules directory junction in that parent pointing to ~/.dsh/profiles/node_modules: mklink /J "<parent>\node_modules" "%USERPROFILE%\.dsh\profiles\node_modules"; if that parent already has a node_modules, retry one level up.
> 4. Restart dsh web and open http://127.0.0.1:3080 to confirm the worktable is back.

This issue has been reported to the DeepSeek Harness team and is being fixed; upgrading after the fix ships resolves it permanently.

## Known limits

- **Platform**: Windows is the fully tested platform. macOS support is experimental: the core file-path code has been adapted for cross-platform use, but no end-to-end test has been completed on macOS hardware.
- State lives in the browser (`localStorage`) — projects, bindings and views do not sync across machines
- The terminal pane is a plain PowerShell host on Windows (no PTY feature parity with the native terminal app)
- Auto-mount requires the agent to actually write `widget-result.json` in the project folder
- The control room monitors projects that are **bound** to a conversation; unbound projects show as idle

---

## Privacy

No telemetry, no network calls beyond the host APIs and the plugin routes. All user state stays in localStorage. Optional update check: a read-only GET to the GitHub Releases API (automatic at most once a day, plus a manual "Check now" button); nothing is uploaded, and it can be disabled in Settings.
